                Edgar Degas (1834–1917) was a renowned French Impressionist artist, celebrated for his mastery in depicting movement, particularly through his pastel drawings and oil paintings of dancers. Although closely associated with Impressionism, Degas preferred to be called a realist and focused on indoor scenes, unlike his peers who often painted en plein air. His work extends beyond dance, including bronze sculptures, prints, and striking portraits known for their psychological depth. Initially trained as a history painter, Degas later applied his classical techniques to modern subjects, creating a unique blend of tradition and innovation in his art.
