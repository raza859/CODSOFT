                Edgar Degas (1834–1917) was a renowned French Impressionist artist, celebrated for his mastery in depicting movement, particularly through his pastel drawings and oil paintings of dancers. Although closely associated with Impressionism, Degas preferred to be called a realist and focused on indoor scenes, unlike his peers who often painted en plein air. His work extends beyond dance, including bronze sculptures, prints, and striking portraits known for their psychological depth. Initially trained as a history painter, Degas later applied his classical techniques to modern subjects, creating a unique blend of tradition and innovation in his art.

        <p class="text-justify">
            Edgar Degas, born Hilaire-Germain-Edgar de Gas on July 19, 1834, in Paris, France, came from a middle-class family with artistic inclinations. His father, Auguste, was a banker, and his mother, Celestine, an amateur opera singer from New Orleans. Raised in a cultured environment, Degas showed early talent in drawing, which his father encouraged. At 18, he began copying masterpieces at the Louvre, honing his skills. In 1855, Degas entered the École des Beaux-Arts but left after a year to study in Italy, where he absorbed the classical techniques of Renaissance masters, influences that would shape his unique style. </p>

        <h5 class="text-center my-5 text-xl">Emergence of Impressionists</h5>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Returning to Paris in 1873, Edgar Degas co-founded the Société Anonyme des Artistes, later known as the Impressionists, despite preferring to call himself a "realist." He participated in all eight Impressionist exhibitions from 1874 to 1886, showcasing modern portraits of women, including milliners, laundresses, and ballet dancers. Notable works from this period include "The Dancing Class," "Woman Ironing," and "Dancers Practicing at the Bar." His controversial sculpture, "The Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer," stirred mixed reactions. In 1894, Degas sided with the anti-Dreyfus faction during the Dreyfus Affair, a stance that strained his relationships within the art community. </p>

        <h5 class="text-center my-5 text-xl">Later Years, Death and Legacy</h5>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Edgar Degas lived into the 20th century, continuing to promote his work and collect art, despite painting less. He never married but had close friendships, including with American painter Mary Cassatt. Degas died in Paris on September 27, 1917, at age 83. While celebrated as a master Impressionist, his legacy is complex due to his misogynistic portrayals of women and anti-Semitic views. Despite this, his meticulous craftsmanship and innovative approach to modern art secure his place as a significant figure in art history.  </p>
